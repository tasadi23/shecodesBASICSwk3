SheCodes Basics — Week 3 🎉🚀
Week 3 was my chance to put it all together and build a real project from start to finish! This week was all about using everything I’d learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully functional interactive landing page. It was so satisfying to see my code come alive as a complete website! 🌟

What I Worked On This Week 💻
Planning and understanding the project overview — getting clear on what I was building 🎯

Writing all the HTML to structure my page — creating the bones of my website 🏗️

Styling the page with CSS — adding colors, layouts, spacing, and making it visually appealing 🎨

Bringing it to life with JavaScript — making my page interactive with events and functions ⚡

Adding the finishing touches — polishing the design, fixing bugs, and making sure everything runs smoothly ✨

Why Week 3 Was So Important 💡
This was where everything came together. It felt amazing to take what seemed like separate skills and combine them into a project I could actually use or show off! I got hands-on experience with real-world coding challenges and learned how to troubleshoot and refine my work.
